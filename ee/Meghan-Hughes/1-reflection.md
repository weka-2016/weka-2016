Why is reflection important?
 - hmmmm... let me reflect on that... Because it helps you learn and grow. You can help others if you understand the process you have had to take to get to where you are. You can identify areas of weakness or areas to improve if you give yourself space to think critically about your work. Also, it's a change to feel good about what you have achieved.

 What did I do well this week?
 - I kept with it. I did ask for help when I needed it, but I tired really hard to find solutions on  my own too. I kept positive and I celebrated the little victories. I made myself stick to SHIPPING ON TIME even if it wasn't everything that I wanted it to be. I learned that you never fix a problem by staring at it. Actually, you don't even find solutions in the same room as your problem. You have to take a break, change scenery - go for a walk, do the dishes, watch an episode of Better Call Saul and then come back to it. And there you go - solution found. On to the next problem....

 What could I have done to improve?
- I need to learn to read instructions better. And let the bigger concepts of what we are trying to achieve wash through my brain before I go ahead and start checking off the checklist. Because if/when things go wrong, if I have just focused on the <i> what </i> we had to do, and I haven't taken the time to understand <i> why </i> we are being asked to do something then it's not surprising I don't know how to fix things.

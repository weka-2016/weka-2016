"We don't learn from experience, we learn from reflecting on experience" - John Dewey.

What did I do well this week?
- I paid a lot more attention to reading the instructions properly before embarking on work.
- I noticed I am far more comfortable (and quick) working in the terminal, Atom and in GitHub.
- I was able to find answers to my problems quicker because I either a) asked for help earlier or b) knew more about what was wrong so I was able to search more tailored questions.
- I was really proud (and surprised) that I was able to answers really clearly questions a friend of mine asked me about what a master is, do controls it, what a local repository is, and what Linux is (she had these explained to her in work capacity but didn't totally understand the explanations).

What could I have done to improve?
- Attention to detail in my work - even though I am reading instructions better, I am often having to re-push work because I have missed something little but important in my code.
- I want to work more on HMTL best practice - Mischa did a great job of finding things to fix in my tidying branch - a tonne of stuff that I missed!
- I need to figure out this CSS thing - I still haven't been able to apply a good box to my blog and it's not difficult so I just have to work it out.
- Exercise a bit of calm at the beginning of the week - as soon as the tickets land in waffle I freak out about how much there is to do and whether I will be able to get it all done.

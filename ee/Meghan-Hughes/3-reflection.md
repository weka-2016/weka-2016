<h4> What I did well this week </h4>
<p> I stuck with it. I managed to keep my stress levels way down this week compared to last week so I went into the tasks with a fairly clear mind. I was really unmotivated though, so I found it difficult to make myself get on with the assignments - knowing there wasn't someone sitting over me making me do it.... So I am proud of myself for persevering when I just felt like crawling up on the couch and watching AHS. Although, tbh I did do that a couple of times...</p>
<h4>What could I have done to improve?</h4>
<p>Procrastinate a little less. Connect with our cohort more to see how everyone else was doing</p>

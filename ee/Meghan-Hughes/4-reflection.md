What did I do well this week?
I keep saying every week that the best thing I did was 'stick with it'. It's still the best thing I did this week!

What could I do to improve?
Be prepared to move on from things I don't fully understand. I was spending about and hour and a half on each codecademy lesson because I felt I couldn't move on until I understood everything 100%. But then when I allowed myself to move on anyway, almost always it would click a little later.

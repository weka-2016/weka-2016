What did I do well this week?
I looked for more ways to enforce my learning - I spent time reading around things and going back to basics.

What could I have done to improve?
I was so keen to get work done that I rushed a few things and get into a muddle and ended up spending far more time on it than if I had not tried to rush in the first place. So I need to slow down a bit but keep to timeboxing assingments so I can both finish with time to spare AND slow down and do extra reading.

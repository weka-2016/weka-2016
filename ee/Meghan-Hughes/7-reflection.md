What did I do well this week?
<p>Not going to give myself any credit - I had so much going on last week I had to push almost all the assignments aside and focus on other life stuff. I guess the one thing I did do well with was allow myself to still have some me-time even though I had to hold down every other ship in the harbour too.</p>
What could I have done to improve?
<p>I could have asked for some help at home so I could have made time to finish the assignments. But everyone was so busy I don't think I would have had any luck even if I had tried.</p>

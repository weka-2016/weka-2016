reflection is important as it allows us to look back on ourselves and our work and make small calculated decisions on what we could do better or even to just give ourselves a pat on the back if we did well.

i think i did well in finding/utilizing resources that could help me figure out things i was stuck on

i could do better at my commit messages (i find them somewhat confusing, which is fustrating cause its such a simple thing)

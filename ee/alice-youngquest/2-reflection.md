what did i do well this week?
i think i did well with catching up fast (this isnt good ideally i would do it on time but sometimes life gets in the way i suppose)
i also think i did well at being mindful or at least trying to.

what could i do better?
i could plan my time better so i wasnt always behind.
i could also be less destracted when i study (i have a tendancy to be quite all over the place and suddenyl when i sit down everything else seems more interesting) i think i need more self disipline!

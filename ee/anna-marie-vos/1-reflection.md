Why is reflection important?
When you reflect on a experiance after completing it, you are able to better learn from it. It's like going through the answers after you've writen a test; you check the answers you weren't to certain about and next time you won't forget them. Its the same for emotional experiances.

What did I do well this week?
I am very proud of myself, I asked questions on slack and I asked a question during our meeting on Thursday. I'm generally terrified of speaking to people (all people are strangers :P).
I also made a webpage ... how cool is that!! not to mention learning commandline and github. Since all these concepts were alien to me, I thought I did really good / ok.
I am also learning to trouble shoot, instead of panicing :)

What could I have done to improve?
I should try to discern which tasks are more important then others a bit better. But, I've got a new attack plan for next week. I'm also going to try a form of meditation to switch off after an evening of coding.

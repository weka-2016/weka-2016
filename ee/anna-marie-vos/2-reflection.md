What did I do well this week?
  I didn't panic too much this week. I changed my webpage look quite a bit and I'm relatively happy with that.
  I understand how to divide webpages into 12 sections.
  I'm happy with my indentations.

What could I have done to improve?
I want to rewrite my webpage a bit so that it fits in with good styleguide coding practices. Specifically the types of selectors I'm using.
I also need to spend a bit more time on moving and boxifying with CSS.

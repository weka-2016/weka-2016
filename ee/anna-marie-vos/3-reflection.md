Reflection 3
What did I do well this week?
  I'm pretty happy with the way my website turned out this week. and I was able to make a button, which is probably pretty easy, but I thought it was awesome to make it.
What could I have done to improve?
  Do more to boxify my webpage. and figure out how to keep text from jumping the line. I know why it happens, just not sure how to change the code to prevent it.

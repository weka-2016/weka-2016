week 4
What did you do well this week?
  I got to the end, is about the best i can say. I had a moment of clarity when it came to classes. But the rest was pretty tough!
What could I have done to improve?
  I was very focused on time, which is good, but I think it subtracted from the learning experiance. Always in the back of my mind if I got stuck I kept thinking... your running out of time, your running out of time. And that made it harder to step back, and take time to logically and calmly go through the code to check for sintax errors (which was a large part of problem.)

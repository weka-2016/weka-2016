What did I do well this week?
I didn't worry too much about time, chich helped me focus on the task at hand. Surprisingly this helped me go through tasks quicker.

What could I have done to improve?
I should try to stick with a problem a bit longer, before moving on. I should also spend more time on arrays. I get some of it, and other bis just confuse the hell out of me.

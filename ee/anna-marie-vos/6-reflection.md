What did I do well this week?
 I didn't give up is about the best I can say. I guess I won the war, but definately lost a bunch of battles. It really bothers me that I did something wrong on github when I published the minesweeper game.  
What could I have done to improve?
  Maybe start the cultural blog and work from there.

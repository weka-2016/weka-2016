What did I do well this week?

Its a little hard finding something I did well, when I feel as though I
failed overall.But, I tried and tried and tried again. I was able to successfully
use the filter  / map methods, on some of the assignments. I switched to
some of the other tasks when I reached my own timebox limit. So that's good.  

What could I have done to improve?
I should try harder to team up. I didn't really try and I missed out on some
good experiences. I really really struggled with the random quotes generator.
I still don't really get it.

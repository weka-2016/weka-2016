What did I do well this week?

I made it to week 8. I thought my calculator worked well until I saw the solution one. Then I knew mine was not good at all. But at least the important bits worked. 

What could I have done to improve?

I need to focus more, I need to learn more about higher order functions
I couldn't impliment it.

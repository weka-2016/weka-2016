What did I do well?
I finally understand API's a little bit. It took me forever and I basically cried the whole Friday because I just couldn't do it. I rubberduckied to my husband and he helped search for youtubes. After watching yet another youtube, and reading the webpages form last week. It finally snapped into place. And my brain went "hold the boat, I get this".

What could I have done to improve?
I should really stop dwelling on the negative. I went through a downward spiral from the beginning of last week and I just couldn't shake it.

I really wanted to write short code, but my code always explodes into a gazillion
lines. I want to try and use filter / map / reduce a bit more.

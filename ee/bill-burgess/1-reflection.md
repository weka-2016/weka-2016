Why is reflection important?
Only through stopping and looking back can we see whether the road we have taken was the best one. It is easy to keep following the same habits, week in, week out without really thinking about why we do them. Reflection is important because it gives an opportunity to look back at what we've done and think about what was great, that we should keep doing, what to be on the lookout for new ways to manage and what we need to stop altogether.

What did I do well this week?
This week I certainly worked very hard, I found the work very challenging and when combined with working in new programs and on a new operating system I had some real trouble adjusting. What I did very well was working through that, taking my time to understand the concepts of what I was working with, watching, rewatching and rerewatching tutorials refering to notes and practicing until I was confident in what I was doing. Once I got into a good rythm with the tools, I also did a good job with .html following the rules and taking opportunities to apply what I'd learned.

What could I have done to improve?
I'm sure there were tonnes of places I could have improved, but the one that stands out above the rest is self management, particularly time management. I did a very poor job recording what I was doing and when on Toggl and did not make the most efficient use of my time. Next week I am going to be paying much closer attention to how I use my time and intergrating the Promodoro Method into my work.

Why is reflection important?
  It is important to try and identify strengths and weaknesses, and
  things that helped or blocked you. It may be internal or external.
  If we don't reflect on what we did we won't improve as fast or
  as efficiently as we are capable of. Reflection also gives us time
  to acknowledge the work we completed, and to go over the learning
  once more which helps consolidate it in our heads.

What did I do well this week?
  I really made myself ask for help sooner than I would normally. I was worried that I would get stuck on a task for too long, so tried to give myself a maximum time allowance and if I couldn't solve it within that time I asked for help. I did the website well as am familiar with html and css.

What could I have done to improve?
  I could have read the resources more thoroughly to start with which may have helped me avoid some basic errors and blocks. I would like to be able to worry less and have more of a growth mindset when I get stuck and can't do something straight away. I got very frustrated and upset while using Github and this affected my sleep that night. I would like to be able to just put the task I am stuck on aside for the time being and move on to something else, without getting upset.

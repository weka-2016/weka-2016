What did I do well this week? Doesn't feel like much. I was pushed for time in everything, and don't feel like I learnt the JS code as well as I could have. I suppose I did the mindfulness listening ok, and have practices meditation nearly every day.

What could I improve - everything...time management maybe, although I was pretty tired this week so didn't get as much done in the evenings as I wanted to.

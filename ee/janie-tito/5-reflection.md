What I did well this week: I did extremely well not to throw the computer out the window. It's not the computers fault. I dealt with frustration and blocks much much better this week. There were no tantrums and less swearing.

I could improve the way I use helpful tools like console.log and learn more about the developer tools. I am not good at studying things I am not interested in, no surprises, buuut I have to suck it up and learn to focus on those topics because they will help me in the long term.

This week I did well to pace myself and do what I needed for me. I went back and revised concepts and repeated tasks in codecademy, because for my own learning I wanted to understand the tasks fully. Even though some in the cohort were able to keep going with the stretch tasks, I resisted the urge to 'keep up' and did what I needed to do.

I could always improve the amount of meditation and mindfulness I am practising.

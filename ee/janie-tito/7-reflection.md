This week I did nothing particularly well. My mediation went out the window and I didn't complete any of the tasks independently. I read a lot of resources, but was not able to transfer that into working code.

I don't think I could have done anything differently. I asked for help. I kept in touch with cohort people. I could have gotten more sleep, that would have helped with concentration levels.

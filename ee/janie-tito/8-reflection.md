This week I did well to focus and continue with the study in the face of earthquakes and floods. We were not physically affected, as are on a hill. But it was still hard to concentrate during the week.
I managed to complete a few Udacity tutorials, which were helpful, and completed the calculator task with the
help of a youtube tutorial. The good thing was that I did understand it.

I could still improve the amount of sleep I am getting, and need to keep to my goal of exercising every morning
with the dog, which requires me to get up 30 minutes earlier each day.

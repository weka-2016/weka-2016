Reflection:

Reflection is important to learn the lessons from the previous sprint. One analogy used in the materials was burning your finger on the stove. The feedback is instant and there is a clear learning. With other learnings such as a maths test, we don't necessarily take the time to consider where the mistakes happen, and how to prevent them.

What did I do well this week:

On the html exercise, I made the time to have a play around rather than just hoon through the exercises as quickly as possible.

What could I have done to improve:

I could have started on things earlier in the week. I could have contributed more to the group thread.

What did I do well this week?

I got started on Monday. This helped by giving me the confidence to take things a little slower and not rush to get through the material. I'll get a lot more out of the course if I play around, experiment, and enjoy the journey.

What could I have done to improve?

I don't yet understand boxes, floats, and other concepts required to structure elements in the way I want. For example my navigational section on my home page doesn't behave the way that I want it to. I could have taken more time on this section, read other resources, experimented, and asked for help if necessary. Another area where I didn't take enough time was Dev Tools. I shortcutted that section too much.

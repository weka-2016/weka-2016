What did I do well this week?

Nothing really! I got quote behind and am only catching up by the next Wednesday... I guess I could say that I didn't panic and just waited until I could make the time...

What could I have done to improve?

I could have pushed myself to really nail some of the blog designs that I wanted to. For example the horizontal column separator line doesn't work for small screens. And my blog needs thumbnails that go through to the actual blog pages.

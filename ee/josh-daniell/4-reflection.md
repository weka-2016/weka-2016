What did I do well this week?

Dedicated the whole long weekend to EDA. Was aiming to catch up, but everything took longer than I expected. Didn't take many shortcuts though, so that was the positive thing. I'm not too worried if I fall behind because I don't need to finish by the time of the immersion phase. But it would be beneficial to stay up to speed with the group.

What could I have done to improve?

Not much. There just wasn't time left in the week.

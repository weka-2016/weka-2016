What did I do well this week?

I was really stoked with nailing a function on the first go. I wasn't expecting it to work, but it came through. Also pleased to catch up with the rest of the class.

What could I have done to improve?

I could have tried doing things myself more before checking out the work of other people. I could have spent more time on the stretch exercises.

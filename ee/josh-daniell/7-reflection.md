What did I do well this week?

Not much! I missed the pair programming aspect which would have been really useful to experience. I'd love to see how other people go about coding tasks, because I feel like I've learnt in a bubble to date.

What could I have done to improve?

Not much! I was too busy with other work to spend much time on coding. I'm glad I didn't try to rush it, or put too much pressure on the other parts of my life by trying to cram it in.

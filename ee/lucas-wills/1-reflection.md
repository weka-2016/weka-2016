Reflection is important because it gives you a way to look at your processes and work output and see if the things you're doing are productive or not. This means that you can evaluate yourself and whether or not you need to change what you're doing and what methods or techniques are working.
I think this week I did a really good job at allocating myself enough time to work through and read all the necessary materials for the weeks assignments. I was very focused and stuck to the timetable I had made myself and didnt give in to outside distractions.
But I should have read through all of my assignments and made a plan for how I wanted to complete them, and made sure that I completed one task fully before moving onto the next. I think that it was a pretty big mistake not organising my assignments properly, and made my workflow confusing and inefficient. Next week I will make sure to properly organise my workload so that my aims and goals are clear.

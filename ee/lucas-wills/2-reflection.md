I think I did well going through the course materials this week. And I also did well practicing things like 2 minutes of mindfulness and meditation. This was useful because I actually ran into a problem with Git which was very frustrating, but I managed to resolve eventually. I still left doing my assignments too late, doing 3/4s of a bunch of them instead of just going through and finishing them completely. Silly. I'm gonna knock out my assignments earlier this coming week. For sure.

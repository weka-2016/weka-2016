I did a really good job of working through my assignments this week, and had the majority of them finished by Wednesday.
This meant I had lots of time to go back through and correct mistakes and other such things, and also meant I was
less stressed. I still didn't check in this week ): though this time it was out of my hands!! So this coming week
I'll make sure I do everything I can to check in.

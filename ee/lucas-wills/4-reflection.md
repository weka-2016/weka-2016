I think I did a good job getting through most of the content. UNfortunately I kinda tripped at the finish line
and consequently didn't end up submitting my assignments until a couple days after Sunday. I am quite annoyed
at myself for that. I let myself get distracted by other peoples needs, which is fine, but I used it as an
excuse to not do what I should have been doing. Which sucks because I've been doing well so far in not going
over time on assignments. Oh well. This week I'll get back on track and get everything in before midnight Sunday. Ez.

This week went alright. I didn't get distracted by anything this time, which means
all my assignments are going to get in on time! Woo hoo.
I enjoyed the Search inside yourself segment a lot this week. I liked writing about it too.
I still could have done my assignments a bit earlier, and then I might have had time
to fix this strange issue thats annoying me right now. So yeah, I'll try to get
stuff done sooner so I have more time to troubleshoot if needed.

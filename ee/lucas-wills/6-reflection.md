Last week didn't go as well as it could have. I was stuck in a bit of a spiral and
the exercises were difficult. I enjoyed doing the blog side of things as always,
but when I get stuck and I'm unsure of how to do things it can get really frustrating.
I did find the answers, but there were a couple days where I avoided working on it
because I wasn't feeling it. Sad times.

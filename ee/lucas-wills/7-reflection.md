This week started really well. I did over half of the assignments in the first two days,
so I was very happy with my progress. But my Mom got pretty sick and had to take the whole
week off work,  so I had to do a lot more to help out around the house and tensions
were a bit high. So I sort of fell off a bit when it came to doing the tougher assignments.
So yeah, good motivation in the first half of the week, with good results.
Then just not enough focus in the second half. Quite stressful.

I know that I could have done better overall throughout my phase 0 experience.
At the start it was going really well. I was had great focus, I understood the content
and was keeping up easily. On top of it! But that is to be expected because HTML
is the easiest part. Then we started learning CSS and it got a bit trickier.
I could get the results I wanted most of the time, but when I didn't it was very frustrating
and disheartening. But still over all, very good.
So we're coming up to half way, and everythings good. HTML is friendly, and CSS isn't too bad,
everything will be fine. And then JavaScript came along.
At the start once again it was fine, it was all very simple easy to understand concepts like
what is a function and how to make one, and then I feel like the difficulty curve shot up
so high so fast, I was walking when I should have been climbing.
And then looking at the work and the descriptions for some assignments (this is easily within
  your capability) made me feel dumb haha. Because I didn't find that stuff easy!
I found myself quite lost really. The last two weeks especially I felt lost.
Only through heeeeeeaps of googling and reading can I see and understand how other people
have approached the problems and how they solve them, but I doubt I could have gotten there on
my own! I feel like I missed something.
And of course it just feeds into itself, the less I feel like I can do something the less
inclined I am to do it. It was reasonably intimidating and you can see that in these last couple
weeks I didn't work on assignments on as many days or for as long.
I always started out my weeks strong. Monday and Tuesday in the morning were the best times for me;
the most productive part of the week. That could be because the first couple assignments are usually
a bit more gentle than the last one or two :P
So I believe I was too easily discouraged. By my shortcomings. I should have seeked more help
or more information. But I have really been looking forward to being with some actual people,
as I find it much easier to learn by example and by talking to people. When I'm at home alone
I'm much more likely to just sit on something and stew haha.
But yeah. The first half of phase zero was great. Even the first week or two of JavaScript was fine,
and then it got hard and I let it get to me. Not enough resilience training!!
Could have definitely put more effort in during the last two weeks. God dammit.

Why is reflection important?
Reflection permits us to own the knowledge we accrue by learning. Reflecting on what we learn, on how we can apply it, on what becomes possible now that we know how to do some things... It is the most important step. The one that turns knowledge into a tool we can use freely, and not simply a dead amount of information.

What did I do well this week?
To be honest, my week has only been a day long, and I've been doing assignements in a disorderly fashion. Which is to be expected, given my special circumstances... I think I've done well by adapting to the fact that I can't seem to log into the VM, and am therefore doing the assignment on my local Windows 10 configuration, and Powershell, rather than the Ubuntu VM and Bash.

What could I have done to improve?
I could definitely improve on the orderliness! I'm hoping things will normalize quickly for me. Also, I think I'm still shaky on the Git workflow. I will try to be extra dedicated to properly reflect on it!

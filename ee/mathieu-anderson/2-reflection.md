 What did I do well this week?
 Well, it's more "today" than "this week". Which kind of leads me to what I think I did well : going through all the material and assignments in a very timely manner. It has been quite intense, but I was lucky to have a little experience with html and css to actually do all the heavy conceptual lifting for me.

 What could I have done to improve?
I definitely could do with more time immersing myself in CSS experimentation, to really ingrain in my bones the box model and the grid design principles, as well as getting more familiar with the commonly used attributes and tricks. Also, with git branching and merging. I unfortunately didn't get to experience this part of the week properly, as the other people of the cohort paid their technical debt a few days ago! But I'm sure I will have ample occasions to practice as the course progresses!

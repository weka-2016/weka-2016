What did I do well this week?
I think the fact I recognized my mistake after redsigning my site entirely AGAINST the framework, and re-redesigned WITH the framework, is a really good thing. I feel like it's been a really good experience, even if struggling against the framework was pretty grueling.

What could I have done to improve?
I could have taken more time to properly read and absorb the instructions for the assignment 3.1, and be saved hours of frustrating experimentations! I think this was due to the sense of urgency that a animates me, wanting to catch up as quickly as possible! I'm happy my mistake turned out to be profitable though. And I'm happy people in the cohort slack channel helped me!

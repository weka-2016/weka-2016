What did I do well this week?
I reached out! I was realy stuck for hours on those two FreeCodeCamp challenges... I couldn't figure out how to proceed. I then talked it through with my PHP developper friend, who, as a JS noob like myself but with consequent programming know how, was able to direct me on the right thought-path. It really helped me tremendously to  jsut bounce my ideas on her and have them shut down or confirmed on a very coneptual level.

What could I have done to improve?
I could have taken a step back, and gone through more  (and different) JavaScript lessons, so as to stumble upon the one nugget that would have helped me make sense of it all (like the time I read that what is on the RIGHT of the = sign is resolved before everything else). It would have taken a lot more time and energy, blindly going through documentation without knowing what I was loking for.

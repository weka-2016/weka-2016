What did I do well this week?
I think I was very efficient in managing the work load and my time, finishing most of the assignments by Wednesday. It gave me time to go back to some basics that I thought I needed to be more afmiliar with, especially Codecademy's JavaScript course and MDN's JS documentation. I also had time to work on a personal project, even if it was mostly built thanks to the generous help of anonymous advice from Internet people!

What could I have done to improve?
I think I should really try harder to implement time management techniques such as the Pomodoro technique or timeboxing. I'm keeping on top of things now, but I should be prepared for when things will unavoidably overwhelm me.

What did I do well this week?
I think I really managed to get the hang of some key concepts of JS, namely loops and objects construction. I also did quite well with the debugging techniques we learnt earlier, and really started to work with the inspect element functionality, and with the breakpoints.

What could I have done to improve?
I think I am still "guessing", trying stuff out and seeing what works and what doesn't, and then iterating to finally end up with something that works. I should be more methodical and rigorous in my approach.

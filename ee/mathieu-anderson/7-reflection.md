What did I do well this week?
I finished all the assignments pretty quickly. I'm happy with how the 4 hours algorithm challenges task went, even if I would have really liked to finish all the beginner ones in the allotted time!

What could I have done to improve?
I could have pushed myself more! Lots of things were very interesting, and I really should have delved into them further.

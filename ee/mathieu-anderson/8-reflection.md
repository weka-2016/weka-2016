What did I do well this week? I am quite happy with the way I refactored the code for the calculator challenge. I managed to make it work with more generic functions... Maybe a little in the spirit of functional programming? Haha!

What could I have done to improve? I think I definitely have a very wide margin of progression in pair programming. I shoulda work on trusting my partner and putting my own thought process on hold sometimes.

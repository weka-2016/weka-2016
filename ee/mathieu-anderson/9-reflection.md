What did I do well through my nine weeks in Phase 0?
I'm very happy I was able to catch up the rest of the cohort quickly, and kept the momentum going throughout the whole phase. I really enjoyed the process of getting stuck, working, and getting unstuck.

 What could I have done to improve through my nine weeks in Phase 0?
 I think I could have gone more in depth in some things. For example, jQuery and APIs are still very mysterious to me.

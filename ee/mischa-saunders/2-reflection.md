This week I did a good job of starting early and moving through the work quickly, while still taking time to stop and learn more
about concepts that interested me or that I didn't understand.

I could have done a better job of noticing where the search inside yourself material fit into the weeks trajectory so that
I wouldn't have had to go over the content a second time when I arrived at the relevant assignment.

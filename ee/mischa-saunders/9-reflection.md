During the nine weeks of phase-0, there were a few things I did well. One pattern I was proud of was not leaving things until they were due, but starting my work as soon as I received it. As phase-0 progressed this give me more flexibility for when I would do my work because I had a greater sense of what it would take to complete the tasks. Another thing I did well was to not be too hard on myself. I enjoyed the learning, tried my best to understand the concepts and methods, but when I didn't understand, I didn't beat myself up.

I can also see a couple areas where I could have improved during this time. One is that when processes I was trying didn't work, I did not manage to effectively communicate my questions to those who could help me. Therefore there were a number of assignments that I spent a long time one because of silly syntax errors simply because I hadn't asked somebody else to look at my code. Another area where I see room for improvement is my time management over the last three weeks. I had a good rhythm for the first six weeks of phase-0, but once I embarked on travelling to NZ, I lost my rhythm and fell behind on the work.  After arriving in NZ I was very occupied with doing web design work for a friend, which was related to the course content, but which often caused me to delay doing my EDA work. I am grateful however that I did travel a few weeks in advance because I am now feeling grounded again and ready for bootcamp!

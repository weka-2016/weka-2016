<strong>Sprint-1 Reflection</strong>

Taking the time to reflect is important in order to understand what you need to change in order to grow in the future. I have not been taking enough time to reflect lately so I am glad to have this be a part of the curriculum.

I very happy with my week, I feel that I have learned so much and my though I definitely wasn't able to grasp a lot of the css formatting but I trust I will figure it out in the future and feel happy with what I was able to understand.

I have a lot of things I need to work on but the main things I want to focus on is my typing skills and and time management - I procrastinated with a few things until the last minute, especially with the time difference. This next week I want to do at least 15 minutes of typing practice each day.

Another thing that I struggled with and need to work on is feeling anxious/restless especially in my body. I have been doing more and more stretching but I think a bit more exercise would help a lot. I did just decide that I would start doing pushup whenever I start feeling anxious during phase 0. I would also guess that being a better/faster typist would help a lot.

I'm very much looking froward to sprint-2 but this week may be a struggle with getting everything done in a timely manor because the music festival I put on is next weekend and I have a lot of last minute things to accomplish.

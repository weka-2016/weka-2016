I was extremely busy last week/weekend and so I wasn't able to even begin sprint-2 until the following Tuesday and so with the very limited time I don't think I was able to give my 100% with every task. I still feel that I learned a lot especially in the structuring of css + html on a webpage using the grip method. I am very much looking forward to rebuilding my website this weekend using the new tools I have learned. I'm hoping to be able to catch up completely this weekend and be able to dive into java next week!

I accomplished most of sprint-3 this past weekend after finishing sprint-2 on Friday so I don't think I was able to put as mush energy into my work as I would have liked. I put a lot of time into building my site even though it has a ton of bugs. I think I learned a lot about what not to do when figuring out a site and what I would do differently next time I start from scratch. I think I really need to work on my typing and so I'm excited to be caught up now so I can work on that more.
